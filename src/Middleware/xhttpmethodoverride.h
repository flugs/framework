/**
* @brief X-HTTP-Method-Override middleware
*
* XHttpMethodOverride checks the incoming request for the X-HTTP-Method-Override
* header and the parameter formParamName() (default is _method) in form or query data.
* Given the current request has been sent via POST, it uses the queried http method
* rather than the actual Request::method() for the following processing.
* These methods can be replaced: PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
* The methods PUT, PATCH and DELETE can so be replaced by POST requests.
*
* This is particularly useful for clients who have to endure a crazy and stupid
* system administrator.
